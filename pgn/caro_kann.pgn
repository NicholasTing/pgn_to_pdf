{Welcome to my 2021 updated Caro-Kann course! In our introductory file I would
like to give you an overview of our repertoire. This is not a comprehensive
file of every single line, rather it can serve you as a roadmap as to White's
and Black's options. I will also outline where I present several options for
Black and my thoughts on how you can pick your preferred lines.} 1. e4 c6 {
Here we go! Our idea is to occupy the center with c6-d5 and adopt a light
square strategy. By attacking White's e4 pawn we also strive to give our Bc8 a
home on f5 square, although as we will see we don't always utilize the
possibility.} 2. d4 {Surely the best move for White is to occupy the center
but he also has some other viable options} (2. Nc3 d5 3. Nf3 {Is a very
popular and sound variation known as the "Two Knights." This variation has
seen a surge of popularity in the last years as it has been recommended in
several White repertoires and new ideas have been found.} Bg4 {is the solid
and most popular move. The main line goes} (3... dxe4 {Capturing on e4 seeks
to transpose to positions seen in the Tartakower Classical variation (see main
line) which have been revived with new ideas for Black in recent years.} 4.
Nxe4 Nf6) (3... a6 {This little pawn nudge is roughly 50x less popular than
the main move 3..Bg4 so it contains great surprise value. It also scores 56%
for Black! We are making a small useful waiting move to control the b5 square
and considering playing Bg4 at a more opportune moment.}) 4. h3 Bxf3 5. Qxf3 e6
{[%csl Gb7,Gc1,Gc6,Gd5,Ge6,Gf1,Gf7] Where White is happy to get the bishop
pair but Black is very solid and puts the pawns on the light squares. There
have been many setups tried for White here but I have an offbeat suggestion
for Black involving a Kingside fianchetto:}) (2. Nf3 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. d4 {
is an offshoot type of Exchange Variation of the Caro. White goes for simple
development but lets Black do the same. The resulting middgames are give us
comfortable play as I will show in the files.}) (2. c4 {is known as the
"Pseudo-Panov" and after} d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. cxd5 (4. d4 {is the Panov}) 4...
Nf6 {White has some options to try to cause trouble before Black collects the
pawn back and short castles. With knowledge of a few key lines Black will
emerge in good shape. I would say this line is not really seen much nowadays
and is not popular at club level, although it is completely respectable.}) (2.
d3 {is a "KIA" (Kings Indian Attack) setup which of course will have it's
Kings Indian fans. I've definitely seen it a fair bit online and several times
OTB but we will get a good game by taking over the center} d5 3. Nd2 e5) 2...
d5 3. Nc3 {Protecting the pawn with Nc3/Nd2 is known as the "Classical"
variation. Nothing more classical than developing a piece and protecting the
center! This variation remains extremely popular but in my opinion is not as
challenging as the Advance variation (3. e5).} (3. Nd2 dxe4 {Will transpose to
3. Nc3}) (3. e5 $1 {I believe that the Advance Variation may be the "best"
line at White's disposal. The idea is clear: grab the space! Now the main move
is 3...Bf5, a move that is certainly very adequate and developing. However, I
am rolling with the less popular 3..c5!} c5 $5 4. dxc5 $1 {This greedy move is
considered critical. White grabs the pawn and dares Black to retrieve it!} (4.
c3 {This is a very important move to analyze. Although 4. dxc5! is arguable
most challenging, 4. c3 is roughly 3x more popular at the club level. However
this move is not so tough as it allows Black a version of a "good french".
Something like:} Nc6 5. Nf3 Bg4 6. Be2 e6 {[%csl Rd4,Gg4][%cal Gd8b6,Gg8h6,
Gg8e7,Ge7f5,Gh6f5] is an example! The position has a French structure (e4 e6
d4 d5 e5 c5) with the key distinction of Black's Bc8 being active on g4! This
is another reason I am happy to recommend 3..c5: many opponents will
unwittingly allow us this juicy continuation.}) (4. c4 $5 {is an aggressive
option}) 4... Nc6 $5 {This is the ambitious way to continue. We refuse to
close the Bc8! I think that unless White has deep theoretical knowledge of the
position then Nc6 would be my choice (and has been vs several master+ players).
However White does have some challenging retorts that we need to deal with.} (
4... e6 {is a solid alternative})) (3. exd5 cxd5 4. Bd3 {[%cal Gc1f4,Gc2c3,
Gb1d2,Gg1f3] This is the "Exchange Variation" and is a very popular line with
Masters and Amateurs alike. It is also a very frequent guest in online play.
The allure of this line for White is the promise of a simple developmental
setup with potential attacking chances.} (4. c4 {This is the "Panov-Botvinnik
Attack." This variation often gives rise to the famous "IQP" (Isolated Queen's
Pawn) structures that has been debating and analyzed endlessly over the past
century. There isn't anything particularly wrong with this line for White in
my view its popularity has been dwindling. I used to place it in the "Big
Four" of Classical, Advance, and Exchange variations but I think now the Two
Knights is more popular. Anyway, my main recommendation is the g6 fianchetto
which can be very unpleasant for White to face if he is unprepared (a common
issue here for club/amateur players!). My surprise recommendation is one that
I've used successfully myself and will either give you a second option or you
can even make it your main idea!} Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {My preference. By
fianchettoing our Bf8 we keep the Bc8 open and also seek to put additional
pressure onto the d4 pawn.} (5... Nc6 6. Nf3 (6. Bg5 Ne4 $5 {This line can
lead to very dynamic play}) 6... Be6 {Surprise! This quirky move seeks to
resolve the pressure on the d5 pawn and force White to make a decision.}) 6.
Nf3 (6. Qb3 $1 Bg7 7. cxd5 {is the main and critical line. We sacrifice a pawn
but will try to collect it back in the future! Again as I have said about
several of the lines in this overview, this is a line that either a Master or
well prepared opponent will use. Of course I have analyzed this idea deeply to
give you good retorts in either case. Nevertheless if you are facing an
unprepared or amateur opponent then the inferior 6. Nf3?! will be seen more
often!}) 6... Bg7 7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nc6 {[%csl Rd4][%cal Gg7d4,
Gc6d4,Gd8d4,Gc8g4,Gb7b6,Gc8b7] is a pleasant anti-IQP position!}) 4... Nc6 5.
c3 Nf6 (5... Qc7 {[%cal Rc1f4] This main line option prevents Bf4 and has
generally scored very strongly for Black.}) 6. Bf4 Bg4 {continues simple
development and usuall White wil try to attack our kingside while we storm the
queenside} (6... g6 $5 {This was the first line I learned vs the Exchange I
really liked and have shown it to many of my students. The resulting positions
are easy to play and White is often unsure how to meet them. Definitely
recommend this line for u2200 play:} 7. Nd2 Bg7 8. Ngf3 O-O 9. O-O Bf5 10. Bxf5
gxf5 {Black scores 56% here. We will occupy e4 and perhaps use the g-file to
attack})) (3. f3 {This is the "Fantasy Variation". This can be a very
unpleasant line to face without preparation as White seeks to have a big
center and attack/squash us.} e6 {Keeping things nice and solid, frustrating
White.} (3... e5 $5 {A violent counterattacking gambit!} 4. dxe5 Bc5 {[%csl
Re1]}) 4. Nc3 Qb6 $5 {Bringing the queen out early but placing annoying
pressure on the d4/b2 pawns. This move has scored excellently for Black but is
not very popular. That is a perfect repertoire weapon for my checklist!}) 3...
dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nf6 {This variation has been around for a while but perhaps did
not enjoy the best reputation as Black is seemingly doubling his pawns for no
gain. However it is apparent nowadays that such thinking was too simplistic
and Nf6 is enjoying a big surge in popularity. I definitely think this is the
move to learn as your main weapon.} (4... Bf5 {This is the main move and is
known as the Capablanca variation. This move is perfectly fine and I have
played it myself for many years and many games} 5. Ng3 Bg6 {White actually has
a lot of pesky sideline setups here but we will just overview the main line} 6.
h4 h6 7. Nf3 e6 $5 {is very interesting and a modern twist. Black doesn't mind
allowing Ne5 and also hopes that the Nb8 may jump to c6 instead in the future.
I think Black is doing fine after Nd7 as well but White may be less prepared
to deal with this modern try} (7... Nd7 {This is the very well explored "old
main line" and often times the opening moves are blitzed here} 8. h5 Bh7 9. Bd3
Bxd3 10. Qxd3 e6 11. Bd2 Ngf6 12. O-O-O Be7 13. Kb1 O-O 14. Ne4 Nxe4 15. Qxe4
Nf6 16. Qe2 Qd5 {While both sides had deviations along the way, this is really
the main line with 750 games played. Again I should say that this "Old Main
Line" is fine for black but has arguably been better trodden than the paths of
7..e6!? or the earlier 4... Nf6 Tartakower.})) 5. Nxf6+ {Really this makes the
most sense but of course we will look at alternatives in the main file.} exf6
$1 {[%cal Gf8d6,Gc8e6,Ge8g8,Gb8d7] As mentioned, Black does get doubled pawns
but now development will flow as free as water. Often times Black will also
get attacking chances on the Kingside by pointing his pieces there and
potentially even sacrificing and pawn storming!} 6. Nf3 {An unprepared
opponent is way more likely to develop naturally as such and the resulting
positions will give Black excellent play and activity. Although I don't think
Nf3 is the best move it is still important to learn and understand the
resulting positions for Black.} (6. c3 {This move, or rather the setup that
follows, has been established as White's most testing idea. Many experienced
players may know this from reviewing their openings but it is very rare for an
unprepared player to play this idea at the board.} Bd6 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Qc2 Re8+
9. Ne2 {Now Black has to make a decision regarding protecting the h7 pawn.
This variation was considered better for White for many years but recently has
been a fertile battle ground for many Grandmasters as Black discovered the idea
} h5 $1 {This move was first played in 2014 but did not recieve attention
until it was repeated in 2017 by several Grandmasters. Since then hundreds of
games have tested this move and it is firmly the main line. The idea in a
nutshell is to get the pawn out of harm's way and often times push it to h4.
The subtleties will be further explored in the Tartakower file. Now White has
a choice: castle long or short? With a few key ideas, Black's game will be
easy to handle regardless and I believe this is an excellent repertoire option
for spirited play}) 6... Bd6 7. h3 O-O 8. Be2 Re8 9. O-O Be6 10. Be3 Nd7 11.
Qd2 Nf8 12. Rfe1 Qd7 13. Rad1 Bxh3 $1 14. gxh3 Qxh3 $19 {[%cal Ge8e4,Ge4g4] is
a taste of how Black can develop and get an attack. See the files for more!} *
